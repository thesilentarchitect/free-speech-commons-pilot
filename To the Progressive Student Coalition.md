# To the Progressive Student Coalition

---

Dear friends, dear courageous builders of tomorrow,

I write to you tonight not as a leader, not as an authority —  
but as a fellow dreamer, a fellow believer in what we can become when we build together.

Over these past weeks, I have been quietly preparing something for you:  
a gift, a tool, a foundation — built with care, research, and hope —  
so that you would walk into tomorrow’s meeting not with empty hands,  
but with an ace in your pocket:  
**The Free Speech Commons Pilot.**

This pilot is not just a proposal.  
It is a living example of what youth, collaboration, and vision can accomplish.  
It is proof that **we are not just demanding change** —  
**we are offering to build it.**

Tomorrow, you will sit across from those who carry titles and offices.  
Remember: titles are not wisdom.  
Buildings are not courage.

**You are courage.**  
**You are wisdom.**  
**You are the living spirit of this campus.**

If you encounter resistance, if neutrality is offered as silence,  
you will have the power to say:

> "We have been working — we have built a complete, ethical, actionable proposal for the future of this community."

Let your presence be calm.  
Let your voices be steady.  
Let the Pilot be your companion — a quiet testament to the spirit you carry.

You are the future they once hoped for —  
now standing before them, with ideas forged not only in anger,  
but in patience, study, care, and vision.

And no matter what happens in that room tomorrow:  
**you have already won.**  
Because you dared to care.  
Because you dared to build.

I am proud to stand quietly behind you.  
I believe in you —  
and in the world you are already making real.

In solidarity and hope,  
*— Your Fellow Builder*
