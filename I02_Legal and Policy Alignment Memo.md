# I02 Legal and Policy Alignment Memo

---

## Purpose

To ensure that the Free Speech Commons Pilot is fully compatible with:
- The **First Amendment**,
- **UNC System Policies** (specifically Policy 1300.8: Free Speech and Free Expression Within the University of North Carolina),
- Federal regulations protecting civil rights and free expression.

This memo outlines the constitutional and policy anchors supporting the Pilot,  
reinforcing that **structural care can coexist with unfettered discourse**.

## Core Alignment Points

| Principle | Supporting Law/Policy | How the Pilot Aligns |
|:----------|:----------------------|:---------------------|
| **Viewpoint Neutrality** | First Amendment; UNC Policy 1300.8 | No event is restricted based on content or viewpoint. Transparency and reciprocity policies apply uniformly. |
| **Freedom of Assembly and Speech** | U.S. Constitution; UNC System Free Speech Policies | The Pilot **expands**, not contracts, opportunities for counter-speech and civic engagement. |
| **No Compelled Speech** | First Amendment doctrine (West Virginia v. Barnette) | Participation in the Ethical Free-Speech Charter is **voluntary**. No student or group is forced to affirm any belief or value. |
| **Right to Know Funding Sources** | Transparency standards in campaign finance and public disclosures; university governance precedents | Event Transparency Addendum mirrors disclosure norms in public arenas without infringing on content. |
| **Supportive Educational Environment** | Title VI, Title IX, Campus Climate responsibilities | Post-event surveys and restorative circles offer non-punitive support for harmed groups, protecting civil rights while maintaining speech freedoms. |

## Relevant Case Law Summaries

- **Healy v. James (1972)**: Universities must respect student expression but may regulate time, place, and manner in ways consistent with educational mission.
- **Widmar v. Vincent (1981)**: Universities opening facilities for public expression must do so without viewpoint discrimination — but may impose neutral administrative procedures.
- **Rosenberger v. University of Virginia (1995)**: Funding or resources cannot be denied based on viewpoint; transparency about use is allowable.

## Conclusion

The Free Speech Commons Pilot is fully aligned with constitutional protections, UNC System policies, and civil rights obligations.  
It **enhances procedural fairness**, **expands access**, and **strengthens community resilience** — without restricting speech based on content or political identity.

In doing so, it exemplifies what free expression was always meant to become:  
**a foundation for belonging, not a license for harm.**
