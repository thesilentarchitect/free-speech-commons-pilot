# I09 Budget Draft v2 (with Contingency)

---

## Purpose

A responsible vision must be paired with a responsible plan.  
This Budget Draft outlines the necessary and foreseeable expenses to implement the Free Speech Commons Pilot successfully —  
including a **10% contingency buffer** for unforeseen costs.

Transparent budgeting strengthens administrative trust and signals organizational maturity.

## Summary Table

| Item | Quantity | Unit Cost | Sub-Total |
|:-----|:---------|:----------|:----------|
| **Peer-Facilitator Training** | 2 cohorts (15 students each) | \$2,000 per cohort | \$4,000 |
| **Facilitator Stipends** | 10 circles × \$75 | — | \$750 |
| **Materials / Refreshments** | 10 circles × \$50 | — | \$500 |
| **Dashboard Platform Costs** | 1 annual license | \$250 | \$250 |
| **Contingency Fund (10%)** | — | 10% of subtotal (\$5,500) | \$550 |
| **TOTAL PILOT YEAR BUDGET** | — | — | **\$6,050** |

---

## Detailed Notes

- **Contingency Fund** covers potential unexpected needs such as:
  - Supplemental facilitator hours if circles grow larger.
  - Emergency venue shifts or A/V equipment rentals.
  - Expanded survey distribution costs or translation services.
- **Dashboard Platform** assumes use of low-cost/free tools first (Google Data Studio, Tableau Public), but reserves modest funds for platform upgrades if needed for accessibility or scaling.

---

## Funding Sources

- Primary: **Reallocation from under-utilized Student Affairs programming funds**.
- Secondary (optional): Supplementary fundraising efforts coordinated by the Coalition (grants, campus mini-funds, community donations).

---

## Sustainability Outlook

If the Pilot transitions into permanent policy:
- Costs likely stabilize or decline after Year One (initial training investment will already be made).
- Peer facilitators could mentor future cohorts, reducing external training costs.
- Dashboard costs could be absorbed into general IT or DEI budgeting streams.

## Closing Reflection

Money is a form of energy.  
Budgeting wisely is not about guarding gold —  
it is about building bridges that endure the first storm.
