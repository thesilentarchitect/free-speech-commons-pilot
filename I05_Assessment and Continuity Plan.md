# I05 Assessment and Continuity Plan

---

## Purpose

Assessment is not judgment — it is the art of tending.  
The Free Speech Commons Pilot will not simply be launched and abandoned;  
it will be **listened to**, **cared for**, and **refined** in real time.

This Assessment and Continuity Plan outlines how the Pilot’s success will be measured, reviewed,  
and — if fruitful — transitioned into permanent institutional culture.

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Target Threshold |
|:-------|:-----------------|
| **Transparency Compliance** | 90% of qualifying events file Transparency Addendum |
| **Climate Survey Participation** | 30% response rate among event attendees |
| **Average Climate Score** | ≥ 4.0/5.0 on belonging and safety metrics |
| **Restorative Circle Participation** | 10 circles conducted; ≥ 70% participant satisfaction |
| **Bias/Incident Log Utilization** | ≥ 10 reports logged and reviewed responsibly |
| **Faculty Ally Engagement** | ≥ 10 faculty endorsers actively participating |

---

## Review Cadence

- **Monthly**: Steering Committee (students + administrators) reviews dashboard data and qualitative feedback.
- **Mid-Year (January 2026)**: Public interim report summarizing metrics, narratives, and course-corrections.
- **End-of-Year (May 2026)**: Full Pilot Assessment Report delivered to:
  - Student Affairs
  - Faculty Senate
  - Student Government Association (SGA)

## Decision Pathways

| Outcome | Continuity Recommendation |
|:--------|:---------------------------|
| ≥ 75% KPI achievement | Transition Pilot into permanent Ethical Free-Speech Policy, with refinements based on feedback. |
| 50-74% KPI achievement | Extend Pilot for 1 additional year with targeted improvements (e.g., better comms, expanded facilitator pool). |
| < 50% KPI achievement | Conduct in-depth listening sessions to reassess feasibility; redesign approach collaboratively if community will exists. |

---

## Data Stewardship

- **Dashboard Data**: Archived annually; anonymized for future comparative analysis.
- **Survey Instruments**: Updated based on response patterns and open feedback.
- **Incident Logs**: Maintained securely for trend analysis only — no disciplinary action without separate process.

---

## Sustainability Strategies

- **Student Leadership Pipeline**: Mentor a second cohort of Commons Ambassadors (train-the-trainer model).
- **Faculty Engagement**: Integrate Pilot principles into first-year seminars, orientation programming, and DEI workshops.
- **Administrative Buy-In**: Present annual Commons reports at Chancellor’s Cabinet and Board of Trustees updates.

## Closing Reflection

Continuity is not a passive gift.  
It is a sacred practice:  
of tending the flame, not simply lighting it;  
of learning to love the work of becoming.
