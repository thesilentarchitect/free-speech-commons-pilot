# 04 Post-Event Climate Survey Template

---

## Purpose

Understanding the true impact of campus events requires more than attendance numbers or headline reactions.  
This Climate Survey offers a brief, structured way to assess how public events influence community trust, safety, and intellectual engagement.

Survey responses guide continuous improvement of event practices, community support, and university policy — **without restricting speech**.

---

## Administration Guidelines

- **Who**: Distributed to all event registrants/attendees and a randomized 10% sample of the wider student body.
- **When**: Sent electronically within **48 hours** after the event.
- **Anonymity**: Fully anonymous; aggregated for dashboard reporting.
- **Platform**: Hosted via Qualtrics or equivalent university-approved survey tool.

## Closing Reflection

To listen — truly listen — is to love the future before it arrives.  
This survey is an instrument of listening:  
a way to measure not simply who spoke, but who felt seen.
