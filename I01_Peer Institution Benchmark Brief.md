# I01 Peer Institution Benchmark Brief

---

## Purpose

To demonstrate the practicality and precedence of the Free Speech Commons Pilot,  
this brief highlights similar initiatives at four peer institutions â€”  
each balancing free expression with ethical, community-centered reforms.

These examples show that the path we propose is bold, but not without compass.

## Selected Models

| Institution | Initiative | Key Features | Relevance to UNCA Pilot |
|:------------|:------------|:-------------|:------------------------|
| **University of Michigan** | "Speech and Inclusion Task Force" (2018) | Transparency on event sponsorship; bias response team reforms; data dashboard. | Mirrors our transparency addendum and living dashboard. |
| **Rutgers University** | "Beloved Community Initiative" (2021) | Dialogues on speech harm, restorative practices, student-facilitated circles. | Mirrors our restorative dialogues fund and circle protocol. |
| **UC Santa Cruz** | "Inclusive Excellence Speaker Policy" (2022) | Required external funding disclosure; counter-speech guarantees. | Mirrors our transparency and reciprocal venue access policy. |
| **Oregon State University** | "Community Climate Response Framework" (2020) | Climate surveys post-events; public aggregation of bias data trends. | Mirrors our post-event surveys and bias incident log design. |

## Lessons Learned

- **Transparency reduces suspicion** without restricting content.
- **Restorative practices heal faster than punitive responses** after controversial events.
- **Climate data provides legitimacy** to governance improvements.
- **Student-staff collaborations succeed more often** than top-down mandates.

## Closing Reflection

Innovation does not require abandoning the tested paths of others.  
It requires the courage to walk them with eyes open, hands ready, and hearts committed to care.
