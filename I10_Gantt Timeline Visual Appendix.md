# I10 Gantt Timeline Visual Appendix

---

## Purpose

The Gantt Timeline offers a **visual roadmap** for the Free Speech Commons Pilot,  
showing key phases, milestones, and interdependencies at a glance.

It helps administrators, students, and faculty partners see not just the destination —  
but the rhythm of the journey.

in the **Free Speech Commons Living Dashboard** for transparent public access.

## Closing Reflection

A map is not the territory,  
but it grants the courage to cross it.  
With every phase, we do not only track progress —  
we **bear witness** to the becoming of the commons.
