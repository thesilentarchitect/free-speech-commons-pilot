# 03 Event Transparency Addendum

---

## Purpose

Transparency is the cornerstone of ethical free expression.  
This Addendum ensures that significant public events at UNC Asheville disclose key structural information,  
allowing our community to engage fully and critically.

It **does not** restrict or censor events.  
It **does** illuminate the forces that make events possible — fostering informed dialogue and accountability.

---

## Applicability

The Addendum is **required** for any event that meets both conditions:
- Expected attendance over **50 people**, **or** external funding exceeding **$1,000**.
- Organized under the auspices of a registered student organization, faculty group, or external partner using campus facilities.

Organizers must submit this form **at least 5 business days** before the scheduled event.
