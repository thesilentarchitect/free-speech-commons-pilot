# Message to the Coalition and Community

---

Today, I share with you the Free Speech Commons Pilot —  
a project built quietly, with care, to support the courage you show every day.

This Pilot is a gift:  
a blueprint for how freedom and community care can live side by side.  
It is proof that we are not only demanding change —  
**we are offering to build it.**

If you're new to the Pilot, start by reading:  
- **My Message to You** — a letter of solidarity and hope.  
- **The README** — a simple guide to what’s inside and how to explore it.

As you walk into tomorrow’s meeting,  
carry this Pilot as a quiet testament to your strength:  
the wisdom of your youth,  
the spirit of your community,  
and the future you are already shaping.

In solidarity,  
*— Your Fellow Builder*
