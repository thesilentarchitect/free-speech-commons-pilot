## Welcome

This archive contains the full proposal for the **Free Speech Commons Pilot**,

## Closing Reflection

> "**Freedom without memory becomes complicity.  
> Freedom with care becomes community.**"

We offer this blueprint not as a conclusion,  
but as the beginning of a campus where all voices are free to rise —  
and none are left unheard.
