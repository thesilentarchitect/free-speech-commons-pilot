# 01 Executive Summary

---

## Purpose

The Free Speech Commons Pilot seeks to bridge the widening gap between academic freedom and community well-being at UNC Asheville.  
Rather than restricting expression, this Pilot proposes a new infrastructure:  
one that supports robust dialogue **and** shields the most vulnerable from institutional neglect.

We do not advocate for censorship.  
We advocate for **ethical transparency**, **reciprocity of voice**, **restorative harm-reduction**, and **data-informed governance**.

We believe that by embedding these principles in voluntary structures,  
UNC Asheville can set a national precedent for a future where free expression and inclusive belonging reinforce each other — not tear each other apart.

## Key Components

| Pillar | Mechanism |
|:-------|:----------|
| **Transparency of Power** | Public disclosure of event funding sources, speaker honoraria, and logistical subsidies (Transparency Addendum). |
| **Reciprocity of Voice** | Automatic venue and resource access for counter-forums following major external speaker events. |
| **Restorative Harm-Reduction** | Community dialogue circles before and after contentious events, based on restorative practices. |
| **Duty-of-Care Metrics** | Post-event climate surveys, bias-incident logs, and public dashboards to guide iterative policy refinement. |

## Strategic Benefits

- **Compliance**: Upholds UNC Policy 1300.8 and First Amendment protections while closing ethical loopholes.
- **Community Resilience**: Offers early, structured outlets for grievances before they metastasize into broader distrust.
- **Administrative Shield**: Moves beyond case-by-case controversies toward systemic, transparent governance.
- **National Leadership**: Positions UNC Asheville as a model for balancing free expression and social responsibility in higher education.

## Closing Reflection

Freedom without care is a hollow drum.  
Together, we build a commons where sound carries meaning — and belonging.
