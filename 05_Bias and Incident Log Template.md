# 05 Bias/Incident Log Template

---

## Purpose

When campus speech events produce harm — intended or not — it is crucial to document incidents systematically, compassionately, and transparently.  
This Bias/Incident Log does not assign guilt; it **records experiences**, offering a path toward acknowledgment, dialogue, and healing.

Documentation ensures that community memory is preserved, patterns are recognized, and interventions are thoughtful rather than reactionary.

---

## Administration Guidelines

- **Access**: Maintained securely by the Office of Student Affairs in collaboration with the Bias Response Team.
- **Reporting**: Open to students, staff, faculty, and visitors via an online form or direct office submission.
- **Privacy**: Personal identifiers will be stripped for all public reports unless explicit consent is granted.

## Reporting Timeline

- Bias/Incident submissions will be reviewed within **5 business days**.
- Patterns identified over time may inform community dialogues, training priorities, and resource allocation — *not* individual punishment unless required by law or separate policy.

---

## Public Transparency

- A de-identified summary of incidents will be published **once per academic term** as part of the Free Speech Commons Living Dashboard.
- Metrics will focus on patterns, not individuals, to foster collective responsibility without escalating adversarial dynamics.

## Closing Reflection

Memory without blame;  
accountability without erasure;  
healing without forgetting.  
This is the soil from which true dialogue may rise.
