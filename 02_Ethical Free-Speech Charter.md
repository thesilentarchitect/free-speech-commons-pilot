# 02 Ethical Free-Speech Charter (Voluntary Pledge)

---

## Preamble

UNC Asheville’s mission calls us to free inquiry, critical engagement, and inclusive excellence.  
The Ethical Free-Speech Charter invites all student organizations, faculty groups, and invited speakers  
to voluntarily affirm their commitment to fostering a community where freedom and care strengthen one another.

This Charter does not limit lawful speech.  
It elevates **ethical speech** — speech grounded not only in legal permission, but in mutual respect and accountability.

## Core Commitments

| # | Principle | Practical Obligation |
|:--|:----------|:---------------------|
| 1 | **Respect of Personhood** | Avoid dehumanizing, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and religiously bigoted language. |
| 2 | **Truthful Representation** | Disclose funding sources, speaker fees, and organizational affiliations (per Transparency Addendum). |
| 3 | **Reciprocity of Voice** | Honor and support equitable access to counter-forums following major events. |
| 4 | **Restorative Dialogue Participation** | Engage in pre- or post-event restorative circles if significant community harms are reported. |
| 5 | **Duty of Care Cooperation** | Assist in the distribution and support of climate surveys, bias-incident reporting, and community feedback. |

## Governance & Visibility

- Signing the Charter is **voluntary** but highly encouraged.  
- Signatory organizations and speakers will be recognized publicly as *Ethical Commons Partners* on the Student Affairs website.
- Withdrawal is allowed at any time with written notice, though it will also be publicly noted for transparency.

## Closing Reflection

Choosing to sign this Charter is an act of leadership —  
a statement that freedom and solidarity are not contradictions, but companions.  
It is not a contract of restriction, but a **pledge to strengthen the commons** we all depend on.
