# 00 Preface
### Free Speech Commons Pilot  
### Building an Ethical, Transparent, and Caring Public Sphere at UNC Asheville  

---

## Preface

At the threshold of every free society stands a paradox:  
speech, unleashed, has the power to liberate — and to wound.

Universities, as crucibles of inquiry, must protect the sacred act of speaking.  
But to protect *speech* without protecting *community* is to build towers without foundations —  
spaces where the loudest, the richest, and the most organized crowd out the fragile flowering of truth, equity, and care.

This Pilot is not an attempt to silence.  
It is not a call to banish discomfort.  
It is a blueprint to **build an ethical commons**:  
a living architecture where transparency, reciprocity, harm-reduction, and collective care  
reinforce — not undermine — the noble promise of free expression.

We offer these proposals not as demands but as invitations.  
We seek not dominion but stewardship.  
We believe that the measure of a campus’s freedom is not how loudly its privileged voices may shout,  
but how safely its most vulnerable may speak.

Let this project mark the beginning of a new standard —  
where courage and compassion are no longer seen as rivals,  
but as necessary architects of a future worth inheriting.

## Opening Guiding Words

> "**We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.  
> Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.**"

## About This Pilot

The Free Speech Commons Pilot proposes a practical, measured, and principled framework to ensure that UNC Asheville remains a beacon of academic freedom — while advancing its commitment to equity, safety, and community resilience.

This document outlines a set of voluntary charters, transparency mechanisms, restorative practices, and measurement tools that together form a living infrastructure of ethical discourse.

We welcome collaboration, critique, and refinement —  
for to build the future is always an act of shared imagination.

## Closing Reflection

> "**Without community, there is no liberation... but community must not mean a shedding of our differences, nor the pathetic pretense that these differences do not exist.**"
