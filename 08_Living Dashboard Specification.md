# 08 Living Dashboard Specification

---

## Purpose

A healthy community requires not only bold speech, but honest reflection.  
The Free Speech Commons Living Dashboard offers a transparent, anonymized, and continuous window into the evolving climate of discourse at UNC Asheville.

It provides **real-time feedback** on event impacts, transparency compliance, and community well-being — guiding iterative, data-informed policy decisions without targeting individuals.

---

## Platform

- Built using **Google Data Studio**, **Tableau Public**, or equivalent accessible visualization platform.
- Embedded into the **Student Affairs** website and linked from the UNC Asheville homepage during Pilot Year.

## Dashboard Metrics

| Metric | Source | Update Frequency | Visualization |
|:-------|:-------|:------------------|:--------------|
| **Event Count by Type & Attendance** | 25Live + Engage Event Systems | Weekly | Bar Chart |
| **Transparency Compliance Rate** | Event Transparency Addendum Submissions | Weekly | Percentage + Missing List |
| **Average Climate Survey Scores** | Post-Event Surveys (Q1–Q4) | Per Event | Line Graph (rolling average) |
| **Counseling Services Uptick** | Anonymized CAPS Intake Data | Monthly | Percentage Change vs. Baseline |
| **Bias/Incident Reports Logged** | Bias/Incident Log | Weekly | Tag Cloud + Table Summary |

---

## Data Integrity

- **Anonymization**: No individual identifiers will be displayed.
- **Aggregation Threshold**: Metrics will only be published once at least 5 independent data points exist, to protect confidentiality.
- **Accessibility**: Dashboard designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for visual accessibility (color contrast, screen-reader compatibility).

---

## Review Process

- **Monthly Review**: Steering committee reviews trends for early interventions.
- **Mid-Year Review (January 2026)**: Public interim report.
- **End-of-Year Review (May 2026)**: Full dataset release and narrative analysis.

## Closing Reflection

Numbers are not the soul of a community —  
but they are its pulse.  
The Dashboard exists not to judge, but to listen —  
and through listening, to heal.
