# I04 Communications Plan

---

## Purpose

Transparent, proactive communication is vital to the success of the Free Speech Commons Pilot.  
This Communications Plan ensures that all stakeholders — students, faculty, staff, administrators, and the broader community —  
understand the Pilot’s goals, progress, and opportunities for engagement.

Strategic messaging also protects the Pilot against misinformation, builds goodwill, and models the very ethics of care the initiative seeks to embody.

## Phased Strategy

| Phase | Channel(s) | Core Message | Responsible Parties |
|:------|:-----------|:-------------|:--------------------|
| **Pilot Launch (July 2025)** | Campus-wide email blast; UNC Asheville social media; Coalition networks | "Free Speech Commons Pilot begins — building inquiry, transparency, and care." | Student Affairs Comms + Coalition Media Team |
| **Event Week Communications** | IG Stories, Posters, Email Reminders | "Forum and Counter-Forum schedules available — come, listen, speak." | Student Comms Interns |
| **Mid-Year Check-In (January 2026)** | Blue Banner Op-Ed, Student Newsletter, Faculty Senate Update | "Midpoint Metrics: How Our Commons is Growing" | Faculty-Student Comms Group |
| **Ongoing Updates** | Living Dashboard public access; monthly social posts | "Transparency is living practice — see the evolving data." | Dashboard Team |
| **End-of-Year Reflection (May 2026)** | Public Pilot Report PDF; Celebratory Gathering Invite | "Our Year of Ethical Commons: What We Built, What Comes Next" | Coalition + Student Affairs Co-Release |

## Messaging Themes

- **Empowerment**: "Every voice matters — and every ear does too."
- **Partnership**: "This is not a regulation. It’s a relationship."
- **Evolution**: "The Commons is alive — growing through your feedback."
- **Hope**: "We are proving that freedom and care are not enemies."

---

## Visual Identity (Optional Enhancements)

- **Pilot Logo**: Simple, minimalist — an open circle (commons) with a speaking figure inside.
- **Color Palette**: Calm and academic (deep blue, light gray, soft gold).
- **Tagline**: "Freedom. Transparency. Care."

(These enhancements could be added if design resources are available.)

---

## Risk Mitigation

- **If Misinformation Spreads**: Immediate fact-based correction issued through official channels.
- **If Criticism Arises**: Emphasize voluntariness, First Amendment compliance, and community-building focus.
- **If Participation Slows**: Incentivize attendance at circles/forums with small tokens (free coffee, bookstore coupons, recognition certificates).

## Closing Reflection

Words are not only what we speak.  
They are what we build between us.  
Communication is the first architecture of belonging.
