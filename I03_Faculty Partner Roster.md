# I03 Faculty Partner Roster

---

## Purpose

Faculty partnerships strengthen the Free Speech Commons Pilot by embedding its practices into the academic life of the university —  
not simply the administrative or activist realms.

Faculty allies offer critical legitimacy, logistical support, and narrative framing across disciplines,  
helping to weave the Pilot into the broader culture of inquiry at UNC Asheville.

---

## Faculty Partner Roles

- **Ethical Free-Speech Charter Supporters**: Endorse public principles of respectful discourse and transparency.
- **Counter-Forum Hosts**: Offer to host alternative discussions or panels when major external speakers visit.
- **Restorative Dialogue Facilitators**: Participate in or mentor student-led restorative circles.
- **Data Review Advisors**: Assist in interpreting dashboard metrics for bias, climate trends, and continuous improvement.

## Closing Reflection

When wisdom leans its shoulder to the scaffolding,  
the building rises not only faster —  
but wiser, deeper, more enduring.
