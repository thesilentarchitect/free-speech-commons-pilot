# I07 Diversity-Equity Impact Statement

---

## Purpose

This Diversity-Equity Impact Statement articulates how the Free Speech Commons Pilot meaningfully advances the values of  
**inclusion**, **equity**, and **belonging** at UNC Asheville.

Rather than treating these commitments as peripheral, the Pilot integrates them **structurally** —  
ensuring that freedom of expression nurtures, rather than diminishes, the diversity of voices on campus.

## Impact Areas

### 1. Reducing Disproportionate Harms

Historically marginalized groups often bear the greatest burdens when controversial speech events occur.  
The Pilot mitigates these harms by:
- Offering restorative dialogue spaces after high-tension events.
- Monitoring campus climate trends disaggregated by identity group (anonymously).
- Embedding mechanisms for responsive care without infringing speech rights.

---

### 2. Expanding Access to Discourse

Freedom of speech is incomplete if only the well-funded or dominant groups can be heard.  
The Pilot ensures:
- Counter-forum access and venue equity.
- Transparent visibility of external financial influence on events.
- Faculty-supported counter-narratives to amplify marginalized perspectives.

---

### 3. Building Community Literacy

Through its surveys, circles, and living dashboard, the Pilot fosters:
- Empathy across differences.
- Critical media literacy regarding event sponsorship and framing.
- A cultural norm where disagreement is humanized, not weaponized.

## Closing Reflection

Diversity is not merely the presence of difference.  
It is the building of bridges sturdy enough to carry those differences —  
and spacious enough for all to cross safely, with dignity intact.
