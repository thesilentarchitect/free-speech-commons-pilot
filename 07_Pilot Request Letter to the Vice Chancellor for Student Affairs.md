# 07 Pilot Request Letter to the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs

---

**Date**: May 30, 2025  
**To**: Dr. Meghan Harte Weyant, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs  
**From**: Progressive Student Coalition (contact: email@unca.edu)  
**Subject**: Proposal for a One-Year Ethical Free-Speech Commons Pilot (Academic Year 2025–2026)

---

## Dear Dr. Weyant,

We write to you with a spirit of partnership and hope.

As student leaders committed to UNC Asheville’s mission of inclusive academic excellence,  
we recognize both the necessity and the complexity of protecting free expression in today’s polarized climate.  
Recent experiences have made it clear that **free speech alone is not sufficient** —  
what we need is a **free and ethical commons**: one where inquiry flourishes without rendering care invisible.

In alignment with your stated commitment to **student-centered**, **data-informed**, and **community-building** practices,  
we respectfully propose the launch of a **one-year pilot project** titled:

> **The Free Speech Commons Pilot: Building an Ethical, Transparent, and Caring Public Sphere at UNC Asheville.**

This initiative seeks to *expand* freedom, not curtail it —  
by pairing robust discourse with structural supports for transparency, harm-reduction, and reciprocal dialogue.

---

## Enclosed Components

The Pilot includes:
- **Ethical Free-Speech Charter** (voluntary pledge)
- **Event Transparency Addendum** (public disclosure form)
- **Reciprocal Venue Access Policy** (for counter-forums)
- **Restorative Dialogues Fund and Circle Protocol**
- **Post-Event Climate Surveys and Bias-Log Aggregation**
- **Living Dashboard for Continuous Community Feedback**

Implementation requires minimal administrative overhead and builds upon existing campus resources.

---

## Proposed Timeline

- **Launch**: July 1, 2025  
- **Mid-Year Review**: January 2026  
- **Full-Year Assessment**: May 2026  
- **Continuation Criteria**: ≥ 75% target metric achievement across KPIs.

---

## Next Steps

We respectfully request:
1. A meeting in early June 2025 to discuss the Pilot's final alignment with Student Affairs priorities.
2. Formation of a **Joint Implementation Committee** (students + administrators) by July 15, 2025.
3. Public announcement of the Pilot during Convocation Week 2025.

We stand ready to collaborate, refine, and co-create this future alongside your office and other campus stakeholders.
