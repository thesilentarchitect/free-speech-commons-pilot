# I08 Endorsement Sheets

---

## Purpose

Endorsements affirm that the Free Speech Commons Pilot reflects the shared values, hopes, and commitments  
of a broad, diverse coalition at UNC Asheville.

These signatures do not bind organizations legally —  
they signify **ethical solidarity**:  
a collective willingness to build the future together.

---

## Instructions

- Signing organizations and individuals affirm:
  - Support for the Pilot’s launch and principles.
  - Commitment to promoting open inquiry *and* community care.
  - Willingness to participate in good-faith dialogue and feedback throughout the Pilot year.

- Endorsements are **voluntary** and **may be withdrawn** at any time upon written request.

A seed cannot testify to the tree it will become.  
But a signature can —  
a small act of faith that what we begin today will grow strong enough  
to shelter many tomorrows.
